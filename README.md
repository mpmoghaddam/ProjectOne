# C8 Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the code we developed in class together, associated with the Flowchart we created.

# Getting Started

1. Get this repository: `git clone https://github.com/EvolveU-FSD/c8-rock-paper-scissors`
2. Have NPM fetch the dependencies listed in package.json: `npm install`
3. Run the program: `node index.js`


# Ideas for experimenting

- get names of player 1 and 2
- handle "bad input" from a player
- limit the input choices for a player
- automatically re-play a match when there is a draw
- have the program support "best of 7 matches"
