# PROJECT-ONE (Rock, Paper and Scissors)



# Getting Started

1. Run the server.js file by writting "node server.js" in the Terminla.
2. When you see the server is listening on port 4000 then open another Terminal window and run the curl command as " curl http://localhost:4000/startGame"
3. The program will run as expected.
4. Thanks for any feedback
